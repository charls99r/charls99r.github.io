        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I am a product-focused engineer with hands-on experience designing, building, 
          and validating embedded and automotive systems. My engineering background is 
          largely self-taught, developed through practical work, experimentation, and 
          real-world problem solving. My work spans the full development 
          lifecycle — from concept and PCB design to firmware development, system 
          integration, and on-vehicle testing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy working at the intersection of hardware and software, especially on 
          systems that end up in real vehicles or physical products. I have worked on 
          standalone ECUs, vehicle electronics, and IoT devices, taking ideas from 
          prototype to deployment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I value clean design, reliability, and practical engineering solutions. 
          I am comfortable owning projects end-to-end and collaborating across 
          disciplines, and I am always willing to learn new technologies or domains 
          when needed. I adapt quickly and enjoy picking up unfamiliar systems to 
          deliver working, real-world results.
        </p>
